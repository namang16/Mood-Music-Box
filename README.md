# Mood Music Box

This is a Front End Project made to practice and learn more about HTML, CSS and JS.
In this Project, You have to select your choice of mood and the language you want,
A Playlist will be generated by JS and you can listen to those songs along with their video.

I have used locally saved video files in this project and their names were specified in script file before hand.
Chosen Mood and Language are passed to player page through URL and after fetching those values, script file adds the songs along with their video source location.

## Features

- It has a nice UI with some button transitions.
- Background Color keep changing on the player page to make it feel realistic.
